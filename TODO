TODO:
- Passing around the region is cumbersome
- Make exiting out of describe calls quicker (awaiting the promise blocks the exiting of the recursive function)
- Handle selected regions some with stacks some without
- Use an event emitter for storing the selected regions, pass it in at the top of the menu
- Fix initial list and describe to not throw an error if there are no stacks
